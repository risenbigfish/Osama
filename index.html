    <h1>Osama</h1>

    <p>
      I am a realist thinker and researcher driven by a deep interest in how ideas,
      systems, and people actually function beneath surface narratives. My intellectual
      focus spans philosophy, science, psychology, and technology, with an emphasis on
      clarity, first principles, and practical truth. I question assumptions aggressively,
      value evidence over sentiment, and prefer frameworks that withstand pressure rather
      than comfort. Whether examining belief systems, human behavior, or technical tools,
      my approach is analytical, grounded, and unsentimental. This site documents my
      academic background, public presence, and ongoing work as I build, learn, and think
      in public.
