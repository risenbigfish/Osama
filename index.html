    <h1>Osama</h1>

    <p>
      I am a realist thinker and researcher driven by an insistence on clarity, structure,
      and first principles. My interests cut across philosophy, science, psychology, and
      technology, with a focus on how systems and people actually function beneath surface
      narratives. I approach ideas analytically, questioning assumptions and rejecting
      sentiment when it obscures truth. I value frameworks that survive pressure rather
      than those designed for comfort. Whether examining belief systems, human behavior,
      or technical tools, my work aims to reduce complexity into usable insight. This site
      serves as a public record of my academic background, intellectual trajectory, and
      ongoing attempts to think rigorously and build deliberately in the open.
